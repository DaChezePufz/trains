# trains

a python program that uses the transport api to grab train times from a local station and display them 


planning to migrate over to the national rail api


*note: the use of the 'apiKeys.py' file will be removed after development, it is there for the ease of use so the devs don't have to remove their api keys and app id's from the 'main.py' file every commit*
