# trains

a python program that uses the transport api to grab train times from a local station and display them 




## Furture plans: RealTime Trains API
planning to migrate over to the realtime trains api 




### Requirements
*note: the use of the* `apiKeys.py` *file will be removed after development, it is there for the ease of use so the devs don't have to remove their api keys and app id's from the* `main.py` *file every commit*

*you will, for the time being, still need to put your api credentials into* `apiKeys.py` *to use the programme*
